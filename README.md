# 🚛 Truck Load Optimizer - Logistics Analytics Portfolio Project

An interactive dashboard that assigns loads to truck drivers based on location, time, and profit goals - while keeping them on track to reach their desired destination by Friday at 6 PM as often as possible.

## 🔍 Overview

The Truck Load Optimizer is an end-to-end logistics analytics portfolio project designed to simulate real-world frieght operations and decision-makng. 
- Match truck drivers with the most profitable loads
- Ensure loads are within their available driving hours
- Prioritize loads that move them closer to where they want to end the week to ensure the driver can spend time home for the weekend
- Visualize assigned routes on an interactive map

The project began as a Python + Streamlit prototype for load assignment logic and evolved into a fully automated Power BI analytics solution, reflecting how operational analytics are built and consumed in enterprise environments.

The solution models multi-load driver assignments, delivery timelines, on-time performance, and route-level profitability across multi-year historical data, with daily automated updates.

## Project Goals

- Simulate realistic load assignment decisions under operational constraints
- Measure end-to-end load cycle time and delivery performance
- Evaluate on-time delivery, efficiency, and profitability.
- Present insights through executive-ready Power BI dashboards
- Demonstrate progression from prototype to scalable analytics solution
  
## 🛠 Features

✅ Multi-load driver assignment logic respecting:

  - Daily driving hour limits (<11)
  - Avaliable driver hours
  - Load distance and payout
    
✅ Fuel cost & net profit calculation

✅ Destination proximity bias toward driver target cities

✅ Realistic mileage calculations using Haversine distance

✅ Built with Streamlit (web dashboard) -> transferred to Power BI

  ## Time & Performance Modeling Features 
✅ Dispatch and delivery timestamps generated with realistic constraints

✅ End-to-End cycle time calculations in hours

✅ On-time delivery classfication based on SLA thresholds

✅ Daily and historical performance tracking

  ## Profitability Analysis
✅ Fuel cost modeling based on miles, MPG, and fuel price

✅ Net Profit calculation per load

✅ Route-level and destination-level profit analysis

✅ Top-performing destinations by volume and profit

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x (Pandas, datetime, automation logic)
  
- Power BI (DAX, KPI modeling, interactive dashboards)
  
- Pandas, NumPy
  
- Folium & Haversine for geospatial logic
  
- Streamlit for the interactive web dashboard
  
- Streamlit-Folium for map embedding
  
- GitHub Actions (daily automation)
  
- GitHub (version control, portfolio hosting)
  
- Excel/CSV (data interchange)

---

## Transformation into a full interactive Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:
- KPI cards for:
  + Average completion time
  + On-time delivery percentage
  + Total loads completed
  + Net profit
- Monthly performance trends
- Geographic route and destination analysis
- Top-10 destination performance breakdowns
- Interactive slicers for date-based analysis

ALL visuals are designed to support operational decision-making

## Automation & Data Pipeline

- Python generates daily laod assignments and historical records
- GitHub Actions automates daily execution and date refresh
- CSV outputs feed directly into Power BI
- Historical data accumulates automatically without duplication
